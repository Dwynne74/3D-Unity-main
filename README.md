**C# with 3D Unity Game Engine**

Here are the core concepts and knowledge I've acquired through working with C# within the 3D Unity game engine:

**Obstacle Course**
1. Unity Scripting: I've learned how to write scripts in C# for the Unity game engine, including how to interact with game objects, components, and the game world.
2. Unity Component Integration: I've learned how to integrate scripts with Unity components such as MeshRenderer, Rigidbody, and Transform to manipulate game objects' appearance, physics, and position.
3. Object Initialization and Update: I've learned how to initialize objects in the Start() method and update their behavior in the Update() method, which is called once per frame.
4. User Input Handling: I've learned how to handle user input for player movement using Input.GetAxis() to get input from the keyboard and move the player character accordingly.
5. Debugging and Logging: I've learned how to use Debug.Log() to print messages to the Unity console for debugging purposes or to provide instructions or feedback to the player.
6. Collision Detection and Response: I've learned how to detect collisions between game objects using OnCollisionEnter() and respond to them accordingly, such as changing the color of an object when it collides with another object.
7. Variable Declaration and Usage: I've learned how to declare and use variables of different types (float, int, string) to store and manipulate data.
8. Script Serialization: I've learned how to use the [SerializeField] attribute to expose private fields in the Unity Editor for easy tweaking and customization.
9. Object Rotation: I've learned how to rotate game objects using the transform.Rotate() method to create spinning or rotating effects.

1. Collision Handling (CollisionHandler): This script manages collisions between game objects, triggers different sequences based on collision events, and allows toggling collision detection.
2. Player Movement (Movement): This script enables player movement in response to user input, including thrusting and rotating the player object.
3. Object Oscillation (Oscillator): This script implements oscillatory motion for game objects by utilizing the sine function to produce periodic movement along a specified vector.
